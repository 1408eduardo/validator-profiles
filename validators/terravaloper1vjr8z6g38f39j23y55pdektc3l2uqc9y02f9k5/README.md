# Talis Protocol

Talis Protocol is a NFT Marketplace based on the Terra Blockchain, operating both on Terra Classic and Terra 2.

In order to sustain Terra's ecosystem and its decentralization, we spinned up our own validator on phoenix-1, v2's mainnet.
Initial commission is set at 10% and will evolve accordingly to the community drive along its life.

Selected proposals, prior to vote and as a community, will be discussed on our Telegram group (https://t.me/talisprotocol) and we invite every Talis staker to head-up here to discuss Governanceâ€™s proposals. You can also find a #validator channel on our Discord server (https://discord.gg/nxBMcMRy).

## Our Architecture

Our validator uses a redundant architecture using AWS.
