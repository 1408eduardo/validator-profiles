# Community First LUNC Validator

![Community First Lunc](communityfirst.jpg)

The Community First LUNC Validator is pro-community and pro-Binance. We want to give community members a voice, and we will vote to ensure that happens. Our community first stance also includes Binance, especially in regards to the support we have received. As a Validator, we understand that a truly decentralized environment may not be possible, but centralization within a mostly decentralized project provides the community with support, guidance, and a path forward.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to place our Community First by educating about governance issues and all matters LUNC. Our ethos is pro-Binance in recognition of their support for the blockchain.

## Our Team

We are a group of individuals that have come together to support the Luna Classic Community through a combination of voting, education, and charity. We are some of the Admins from the Binance & Lunc community Telegram group.
