# RuneTerra
RuneTerra is a newly rebranded validator, independent of the zerosumprotocol project. To challenge various networks in the cosmos ecosystem, we took the first step in Terra. We are planning to create a new brand page and a new function for the delegator soon.

## Team

Our team is with the product development team, we have 3 team members as below.

| Name            | Role    | 
| --------------- | ------- | 
| Rune            | DevOps  | 
| Min             | Front   | 
| Gyu             | Core-dev| 

## Our Architecture

We basically adopt a triple sentry structure, and we're using hsm.
And it is possible to monitor 24 hours a day using its own monitoring system, and real-time response is possible because 3 people work in shifts.
