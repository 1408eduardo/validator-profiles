Lunanauts have a solid foundation of servers behind us in colaberation with a team of validators working together,
using sentry node architecture and secure private networks all intertwined.

This gives us a stong and robust server node architecture keeping us online 100% giving our delegates full uptime.

We are big believers in decentralisation and will fight for a decentralised Luna Classic blockchain across all validators, spreading voting power equally. This is key to Luncs future!

We also BURN a percentage of our yield to the luncburner.wpp which utilises sending thousands of transactions per burn instead of one.
This also helps fill up the oracle pool aswell as more tx fees!

Our aim is to fund development on and within the Luna Classic blockchain, helping stabilise and grow Lunc well into the future!

## Our Architecture

We are sticking to the best practice with Sentries → relay nodes → validators
