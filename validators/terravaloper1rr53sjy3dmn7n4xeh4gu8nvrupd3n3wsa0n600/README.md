By the community for the community validator node, half of our commission will be burned and the other half the community will decide what we do with it but currently it is being used to fund DApp development (Layer 2). We will also try our best with providing the necessary education (www.luncwikipedia.com) for everybody so we are on the same wavelength, throughout our journey we will be as transparent as possible with all our decisions.
