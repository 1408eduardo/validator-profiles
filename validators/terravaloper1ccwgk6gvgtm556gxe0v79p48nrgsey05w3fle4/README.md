# Luna Station 88

Luna Station 88 is the independent blockchain infrastructure provider.
We started in 2017 with Ethereum mining, but in 2021 we completely switched to the bright side - proof of stake (PoS) validation, which is the most promising and green blockchain technology.

## Team

Everyone knows that technology is important, but without people, itâ€™s nothing. 
Therefore, our team consists of professionals in their field, ready to solve any problem at any time.



## Our Architecture

We use advanced cloud technologies to ensure trouble-free operation.
Continuous monitoring reduces the likelihood of low validator performance. This ensures a stable generation of rewards for our delegates.

## Ecosystem Contributions

In addition to running a full validating node in the Terra ecosystem our colleague Roman (aka RomanS) actively participates in the [Terra Classic validators discord channel](https://discord.gg/Bvq9ZPQx7s)
and Terra 2.0 validators discord channel.
He is always ready to help if someone has any difficulties or just have some questions.
