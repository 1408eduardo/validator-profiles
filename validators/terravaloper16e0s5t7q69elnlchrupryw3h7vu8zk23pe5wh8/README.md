# JESUSisLORD

![JESUSisLORD](./logo.jpg)
  
JESUSisLORD is an advanced non-custodial Luna Classic (LUNC) validator owned by Christopher Harris, a Bible believing Christian, powered by first-class staking provider Allnodes. Enjoy excellent 99.9% server uptimes, maximum 5% commission, minimum 95% rewards rate, high security and updates. 


## Validator Tecnical Information  
  
My validator is a non-custodial advanced plan with Allnodes, meaning Allnodes has never seen my operator seed phrase, which is kept securely with encryption. My validator is decentralised over up to 15 servers, has a shared standby server and is shielded by 2 Sentry Nodes, and has automatic updates. Enjoy the high security and peace of mind expected from the first-class and professional validator service provider Allnodes. 
  
After JESUSisLORD reaches 2% voting power my validator will be automatically upgraded to the enterprise plan with Allnodes, with 99.98% uptime, a dedicated standby server and shielded by 5 Sentry Nodes. Delegate with JESUSisLORD for top of the line technology, decentralisation, security and service.  
   

## Validator Mission 

My mission for my validator JESUSisLORD is to fulfill the righteous Christian vision for LUNC, and to protect it. I will engage in governance to this end, and endeavour to communicate with my delegators. I invite all who share my cause to delegate with me. God bless you. Christopher.
