# JESUSisLORD

![JESUSisLORD](./logo.jpg)
  
JESUSisLORD is an enterprise non-custodial Luna Classic (LUNC) validator owned by Christopher Harris, a Bible believing Christian, powered by first-class staking provider Allnodes. Enjoy excellent 99.98% server uptimes, maximum 5% commission, minimum 95% rewards rate, high security and updates.  


## Validator Technical Information  
  
My validator is under an enterprise plan with Allnodes, and is non-custodial, meaning Allnodes has never seen my operator seed phrase, which is kept securely under encryption. The enterprise plan is the highest-tier available, decentralised over up to 15 servers, has a dedicated standby server, is shielded by 5 Sentry Nodes, has over 99.98% uptime, and has automatic updates.  
  
Enjoy the high security and peace of mind expected from the first-class and professional validator service provider Allnodes. Delegate with JESUSisLORD for top of the line technology, decentralisation, security and service.  
   

## Validator Mission 

My mission for my validator JESUSisLORD is to fulfill the righteous Christian vision for LUNC as God leads me, and to protect it. I will engage in governance to this end, and work towards fulfilling my Validator Roadmap, and my Vision Plan for LUNC to $1+. 

I endeavour to communicate with my delegates, and invite all who share my cause to delegate with me, so I can achieve higher voting power and fulfil my validator mission. God bless you. Christopher.
