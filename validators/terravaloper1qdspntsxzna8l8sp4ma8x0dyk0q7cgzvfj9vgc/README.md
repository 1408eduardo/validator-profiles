## About Us

We are a group of friends (3) who invested in Terra a.k.a. Terra Classic and got rekted badly with all/most of our LUNA being liquidated or hodling to near $0. With Terra 2, we see a second chance in rebuilding our portfolio and at the same time, an opportunity to start a validator and contribute to the community/our delegators in the most direct way – sharing 50% of our validator’s profits/commission. 

As a start, we have set our commission at 0% for the first month as we access what will be the operating cost of being a validator. In the next few months, our goals are:
1. Get into active set again (we got into active set for a brief moment after we redelegated our own vested $LUNA but after a good night sleep, we are now short of ~10k moon). We would like to thank those that delegated to us while we are still setting up/figuring things out.
2. To become sustainable and profitable (commission > infra cost/expenses) with low commission (maximum of 5% or lower).
3. Once we are profitable, we can start sharing 50% of our commission with our delegators. No concrete plan at the moment because we do not know whether we will even achieve the first point but the current idea is a lucky draw/airdrop for x number of delegators. Ideally, we want give our delegators to a higher yield than the regular staking yield.
4. In addition, once we start collecting commission, we are going to offer 100% slashing protection in the form of airdrop in the event that our validator gets slashed for whatever unfortunate/unknown reason.

We are here to distract you from the pain of being rekted. Please stake/redelegate with us and hopefully, our journey will be less painful together.

## Our Architecture

Our main infra is deployed on AWS with backup infra on Google Cloud. Prometheus analytics, Prometheus node exporter, grafana and others script for DDOS mitigation and reporting tools.
We promise 100% uptime for our validator infrastucture and we are going to offer 100% slashing protection in the form of airdrop in the event that our validator gets slashed for whatever unfortunate/unknown reason.
