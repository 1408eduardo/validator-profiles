# Moon Platoon
Moon Platoon is a community created after the Luna Classic exploit. We did not like that people who bought post de-peg couldn't vote on proposals or delegate. While we understood the reasoning behind this, we felt we didn't have a voice in the process. We decided to create Moon Platoon to make sure that in Luna 2.0 all Luna holders have a vote. We believe in putting the community first and making informed decisions on proposals that will affect our delegators and the ecosystem as a whole. We hope that if you share the same values then you will delegate to us so that YOUR voice will be heard, and earn you some sweet sweet staking rewards for putting your faith in Moon Platoon's mission, infrastructure, and dedication to the project.
